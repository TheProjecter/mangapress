# Getting Started #

Now that you have activated the plugin, there are a few things you are going to need to know depending on whether you’re using your own theme or if you’re modifying a 3rd party WordPress Theme.

## Read this section first! To get started: ##

  1. Create two new pages — or feel free to use existing pages.
  1. Go to the Manga+Press Options page and set your latest comic and comic archive pages to the pages you wish to display your comics on.
  1. If you wish, activate the "Automatically insert comic navigation code into comic posts" option.

I would suggest using the third option if you’re uncomfortable modifying your existing theme and you're not going to use the bundled Manga+Press theme.

That's it! You're done!

## Modifying a 3rd party Theme ##
You may not have to modify the theme in question. Activate the "Automatically insert comic navigation code into comic posts" option. It is on the first tab of the Manga+Press Options page. Click that and also select "Exclude comic category from front page," then click the Update Options button. If everything appears okay, then you shouldn't have to modify anything. If there are some glitches, then you may to adjust your theme. Check out the section on Manga+Press's Template Tags to get started.
