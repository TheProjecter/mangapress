# Manga+Press Webcomic Manager #
## Moved to GitHub ##
I've since moved Manga+Press version control to GitHub. You can view the new repository [here](https://github.com/jesgs/mangapress)

Manga+Press is a webcomic management system for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). Manga+Press uses [WordPress'](http://wordpress.org/) posts, pages and categories to help you keep track of your comic posts. Manga+Press also includes its own custom template tags to help make creating themes easier.
